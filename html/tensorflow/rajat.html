        <h1>What is TensorFlow?</h1>
        <hr>
		<h4 class="subtitle" id="subsection1">Introduction</h4>
        <p>
        TensorFlow is an open-source framework for performing mathematical computations,
        primarily used for its portable, scalable implementations of machine learning
        algorithms to applications such as deep neural networks<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. In this way, TensorFlow’s
        implementation results in little effect to performance when scaling up
        (large server clusters with GPUs) or scaling down (i.e. Android or IOS device).
        This is further extended by the TensorFlow’s ability to conduct training and
        execution aspects of ML algorithm efficiently in a distributed manner across
        multiple, different computing devices.</p>

        <p> Deep Learning has massively influenced the field of Computer Science, with
        these ideas giving rise to highly functional applications with ‘smart’ abilities.
        Google was making use of these techniques to power the algorithms behind its
        search, mail, photos and speech recognition tools. At the time, this was being done
        with its DistBelief<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
        framework, but as the need for machine learning grew, a more robust and efficient
        implementation was needed. TensorFlow arose from the need to generalise different
        machine learning implementations across Google to allow engineers to reuse the
        basic code base for future projects. After open-sourcing TF,
        Google released a distributed version of the framework alongside its Google Cloud
        Machine Learning infrastructure to train and serve TF models<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>.</p><br>

        <h4 class="subtitle" id="subsection2">Advantages for Cloud Computing</h4>
        <p>
        The main advantages to using TensorFlow for any distributed, iterative calculation
        (with the case of ML) stem from its implemented as a data flow graph. I will
        explore these more as I go along, but will outline them here:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Portability</b> -
            At its heart TensorFlow is written in C++, however there also exist the more widely
            used <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow">Java, Go, Python and a slightly higher level C++ API</a>
           built on top of the C++ core. The
            Python API being most prominently used in research and for any high level ML
            applications. This abstraction gives rise to the graph data flow model, by
            hiding the complexities of how the model is deployed and executed differently
            on different platforms. With best practices being encoded at the low level,
            developers can focus on the larger tasks at hand. Developers need not consider
            how the core libraries are implementing algorithms on different devices, as
            optimisation have been made to ensure similar runtimes across platforms. In
            this way, we can abstract away the actual implementation and visual our algorithms
            as a graph, with this being the high level models object orientated realisation.
            In this way, Python’s TF API, for example, will allow for the same code to be
            run on Android devices or across a large cluster of servers running on GPUs alike.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t64ortpgS-E"
        frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Flexibility</b> -
          	TFs high level APIs provide a highly flexible set of libraries that allow complex
          	mathematical procedure to be written with ease. The graph model can be built up as
          	a series of discrete units, nodes, with data pipelines, vertices, between them.
          	This allows for speedy experimentation with little hit to performance. In the case
          	of a neural network, parts of the network can be replaced or restructured by
          	refactoring the graph. The core will automatically refactor the platform specific
          	low level code.
          	<br><br>
          	Small changes in the description of how the computation is to be performed can
          	extend the domain over which the code runs. For example,
          	<br><br>
          	<code style="width:40em">
            &ensp; parameter_server = ["localhost:2222"] # master <br>
            &ensp; workers = ["localhost:2223", "localhost:2224", "localhost:2225"] <br>
            &ensp; cluster = tf.train.ClusterSpec( <br>
            &ensp; {"ps": parameter_server, "worker": workers}) <br>
            </code>

          	<br>
          	which we will explore <a href="#subsection14">further later on</a>. If I add more IP addresses to the parameter_server
          	or workers list, the code will be distributed across those devices too (provided
          	a TF server is running on them). In this way, the same model for a neural
          	network could be trained in the cloud, distributed over some large cluster and
          	then served on another platform, if it were deployed across different networks or servers.

        <h1>Machine Learning In Context</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
        It is beyond the scope of this project to go into the details of machine learning
        algorithms, but we can however discuss the basic concepts with the help of an example.
        We will be implementing an ML algorithm to classify handwritten digits after training
        on the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST dataset</a>.
        </p>
        <h4 class="subtitle" id="subsection3">Supervised Learning with Softmax Regression</h4>
        <p>
        We will examine an example which used supervised learning. This technique involve
        training a model on a set of example input-output pairs (training data), so as to
        learn a function for mapping any other inputs to outputs<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> (Russell S, 2009).
        From this we expect the model to establish a sensible inductive bias, a set of
        assumptions the model can use for future mappings<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>.

        The technique we will examine is called softmax regression, which can be used to
        classify an observation into one of more than 2 categories<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> (F Herrera et al, 2016). This is a generalisation of the logistic
        regression, which makes a binary classification (this is beyond the scope of this
        project by can be further read about <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-logistic-regression/">here:</a>
        <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>. Where the logisitic regression classifies a
        normalised input vector using a logistic (sigmoid) function, the softmax algorithm
        using a so-called softmax function, which generalises the sigmoid.
        </p>

        The softmax algorithm for the MNIST classification problem (WLOG) is as follows:

        <ol class="personal-page-list">
          <li class="">
            <span>1.</span>
            <p>
            <br>
            Establish k possible classes, a class for each number 0 to 9.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>2.</span>
            <p>
            <br>
            We compile all the images we want to classify into a features matrix (X, dim(X) = n x m),
            where we want to class m images (features), with n observations made about each
            image. If we want to classify with 100 handwritten digit images which are in
            black and white, where each image has size 28x28 pixels containing either a 1
            or 0, then n = 100, m = 28 ^ 2 = 784 and k = 10 (from above). So each image
            to be classified is a m-row vector.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>3.</span>
            <p>
            <br>
            Weight vectors are computed for each class (each number). This will involve
            unravelling each image for each class in the MNIST training data set, and for
            each pixel determining a number which represents its level of “zeroness” or
            “oneness”. i.e. how close each pixel is to being a 1 or a 0 for each number.
            Each weight vector is put into a weight matrix (W, dim(W) = m x k). So each class (number)
            is represented as a m-column vector. Each weight vector is initialised with
            arbitrary images which follow a normal distribution, i.e. 1s are closer to the
            centre of the image than 0s.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>4.</span>
            <p>
            <br>
            Z = xW (dim(Z) = n x k). Each element in the k-row vectors of Z gives us a score of how close
            it is to being one of the classes. We pick the max value as the class that it
            belongs to e.g. if Z_30 = [1.2, 1.4, 0.4, 1.3, 1.6, 5.4, 1.1, 0.1, 1.7, 0.6]
            means that our model predicts the 30th observation to be the number ‘5’. This example is taken
            from <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/softmax-regression-using-tensorflow/">here</a>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>5.</span>
            <p>
            <br>
            Now we use the softmax function to convert each score in Z to a probability,
             such that the sum of all probabilities in a row is 1. This allows us to use
             the gradient decent algorithm to learn from the classification we made in
             step 4 and build up the weight matrix we began computing in step 3.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>6.</span>
            <p>
            <br>
            Each observation vector comes with a target vector, which uses one-hot encoding.
            This assigns a 1 to the index that contains the expected result and a 0 to all
            the other ones which it is not. We feed the one-hot encoded matrix and <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html">softmax
            probability matrix into a cross-entropy function</a>. This calculates the error in
            identifying each number (each value in S is between 0 and 1 since S consists of
            probabilities, so a the absolute log of a number closer to 0 is larger than a
            number closer to 1, so a more accurately predicted number will have a larger
            cross-entropy value). We compute the cross entropy function for each row in the
            softmax matrix, and find an average error across the whole matrix (The SVM Classifier Oxford lecture 2 notes).<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>

            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>7.</span>
            <p>
            <br>
            Finally we use gradient of the average entropy loss function to update the
            weight matrix (gradient descent) (For more info click <a href="http://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html">here</a>).
            We repeat this process for some number of iterations over the training set or
            until the average loss function is below a threshold.

        recognised<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>.
        We want to use neural networks for deep learning in this case, which is made possible
        through a network with multiple layers hidden/unseen layers between the input and
        output, each applying different functions to the data.
        . At each layer, nodes perform
        computations to realise the prominence of a particular characteristic in the
        input data. A summation of the input/weight products input into a node is taken
        and passed through the nodes’ activation function to determine probabilistically
        how prominent a particular characteristic is. These output will then be passed
        to the nodes of the next layer for further abstraction to be performed<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
        If the activation function is a softmax, the returned output probabilities are
        distributed over each of the distinct output subclasses for that layer: the outputs
        from each node will then be between 0 and 1 and have a total sum of 1.
        </p>
        <p>
        A convolution neural net differs to the conventional ANN in that a filter (neuron)
        convolves around the input (features) matrix at each layer. These are used almost
        exclusively for computer vision. There are 2 mains types of layers in the CNN:

        <ol class="personal-page-list">
          <li class="">
            <span>1.</span>
            <p>
            <br>
             <b>Convolutional Layer</b> - This filter is a weight matrix, which is convolving
             around an input and is multiplied to each patch in the feature matrix, at each
             stage. At each convolutional layer in the CNN, a filter learns the features
             from the outputted mapping tensor, by supervised learning methods (as described
             in the above section) and adapts its weights to make better predictions. Thus
             at each C-stage, the same features matrix can be inputted multiple times to
             further train each filter. On each iteration, a new output features matrix is
             produced. There may be multiple filters working at each layer to produce a
             different output matrix for different aspects of the initial matrix, this leads
             to the stacking effect.

              <b>Pooling Layer</b> - Pooling filters reduce the size of a feature matrix by
              selecting only the most prominent feature from a patch. In max pooling, where
              the values in each patch are a set of features determined from the activation
              functions at some preceding layer in the network, then the max feature is the
              most detected feature. So only this needs to be passed through to the next
              layer. This is to make future predictions scale and orientation invariant.

          <p>
            The following data structures will be important when considering how distributed ML
            algorithms are implemented.

              <p>
              <b>Tensor</b>
              - In mathematics a tensor is a structure which describes linear relations
              between vectors and scalar. Similarly in TensorFlow, these represent edges in
              the graph (as mentioned above) and are implemented as a wrapper for an
              n-dimensional array.

              <b>Variables</b>  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk" aria-hidden="true"> </span>
              - A wrappers of persistent tensor which survives each execution of a graph.
              During gradient descent for example, the full graph is executed many times
              whilst not maintaining the initial tensors. Here persistence stores are needed
              to maintain the weights for a layer in a neural network. In a run call,
              variables are re-assigned to the new value which was calculated for them
              during the traversal of the graph (consider how the weight matrix is updated
              during training). These are treated as nodes with the graph.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>

              <b>Queues</b>

              parallel/distributed processing. RandomShuffleQueue can dequeue operations
              in random order and be written to by multiple threads. These are just like
              variables in that they are not changed on they persist between sessions and
              have concurrent FIFO access.

        <h4 class="subtitle" id="subsection7">Graph Model</h4>

        <p>
        Computations in TensorFlow are described by a directed graph. When coding we built
        up this graph up: each node performs a TensorFlow operation and the edges are modelled
        as tensors/matrices. This is because the data being passed between 2 nodes provides
        the connection between 2 discrete processes in the algorithm. We can imagine traversing
        the graph as following the overall flow of data from the inputs to the output of
        the code. This allows us to build up our machine learning model in smaller
        discrete parts, making it easier to reason about the stages of a machine learning
        algorithm as opposed to the details of the implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, when we write the following code using simple TensorFlow operation:
        </p>
        <div align="center">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rajowl/a2e6cc06e2bdca58fc2ebe3d10e76fee.js"></script>
        </div>
        <p>
        which translates to the following graph:

        <p>
        Similarly, we get the following graph from the ML algorithm above:
        </p>

        Image of graph

        <p>
        We can generalise graph formation to the following execution model:
        <ol class="personal-page-list">
          <li>
            <span>1.</span>
            <p>
             <b>Sessions</b>
             - Client programs create a session for each tensor flow graph which is to be computed.
            </p>
            <code style="width:40em">
            ... <br>
            with tf.Session()/tf.InteractiveSession() as sess: <br>
            &emsp;&ensp; # running the graph <br>
            ... <br>
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>2.</span>
            <p>
             <b>Extending / Adding</b>
             - Internally, an extend method is called which allows us to add more nodes and edges
             to the graph. (Any mathematical operation: lines 5,6,8,9,10,14,15,17)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>3.</span>
            <p>
             <b>Run</b>
             - The run method takes the set of output names which need to be computed
             and passes the input tensors into them. This then calculates the transitive closure
             of the graph to get the outputs. It passes the tensor output values from each node
             to the next and moves through graph.
             <br><br>
             The executions of a TensorFlow graph is lazy in that unless we explicitly run
             the session, no values are calculated. As we build up the graph, we are merely
             passing references from sections of the graph to others, by assigning a tensor
             object the connecting edge.

        <h1>Distributed Computing in Context<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
        By popular demand, Google introduce a distributed computing framework to TensorFlow
        alongside their cloud machine learning tool in early 2016<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>.
        This section combines basic ML concepts with the general execution model of a TF
        graph, to see how TF can scale (machine learning) algorithms to a distributed system.
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle" id="subsection9">Graph Model in Distribution</h4>
          <p>
          Nodes can be distributed across the devices being used to compute the graph<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>.
          On a single CPU TensorFlow will make use of all cores by multithreading.
          TensorFlow will map the execution of a node in the graph to a device using a
          placement algorithm. For this purpose the graph model is particularly advantageous,
          as by ensuring that each operation is distinct, we can divide stages of an algorithm
          more clearly. The algorithm applies a greedy heuristic to the placement of nodes
          on devices by considering whether (1) there exists an implementation of an operations
          for a device, (2) side of the input and output tensors of the op, (3) expected
          completion time for the operation on a device and (4) the transmission time of
          tensors between cross-device nodes. This is a cost model/function; generally we can think
          of it as holding the input and output tensors for each node and store computation
          times for the operations at each node given its input tensor for a particular device.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>

          </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle" id="subsection10">Master/Worker Model</h4>
          <p>
          <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/distributed#create_a_cluster">TensorFlow docs</a>
          define cluster differently to the <a href="./../../index.html#a-class">conventional definition</a>:
          "a set of tasks that participate in the distributed execution
          of a TF graph". The graph model enables a convenient implementation of clusters
          and servers. Clusters can be implemented as a set of nodes, where, by the definition
          of a TensorFlow node, each node performs a single operation. Since all TensorFlow sessions
          are multithreaded, all processing is done in parallel.
          </p>

          <p>
          The master/worker model in TensorFlow assigns a master, a parameter server, and
          workers. For a distributed system, the parameter server preserves the mutable shared
          parameters and workers execute some subgraph of the main graph using data from
          the parameter server. Each worker is a separate device (for simplicity).
          Once graph node allocation has occurred, send and/or receive nodes are added
          to each worker’s subgraph. These enforce a direction to the dataflow between
          subgraphs to compose the whole graph over the distributed system. The send and
          receive nodes synchronise data flow between workers<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>. In this way, only a single
          call to run the session is needed, in order to pass the input tensors into the
          input nodes, and the remaining data flow will be  will handled by the workers.
          This adds to the overall flexibility of this cloud computing platform, alluded
          to in the introduction section, as even by adding more devices/workers to the
          system, TensorFlow will automatically handle node allocation and the initialisation
          of send and receive nodes. When scaled, communication between workers may be
          handled by TCP.

        <h4 class="subtitle" id="subsection10">Distributed Data Storage Structures</h4>
          <p>
          Variables update their values at the end of each execution of
          the graph (mutable). These are a global data store and can be accessed by different sessions
          running their own version of the graph. These are held in the parameter server.
          In this way, data can persist across multiple devices or threads.
          </p>
          <p>
          Queues can be used as opposed to the feed-dict parameter to the run function. Queues have thread-safe
          implementations<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>.
          All TensorFlow session are multithreaded, so devices can enqueue randomised examples in parallel (input-output sets)
          that can be learned from. A training thread can dequeue and execute in mini-batches,
          akin to the diagram below, the algorithm can iterate in this way to learn.
          A thread might apply a pre-processing function and enqueues the image, a training
          thread can dequeue and learns the images.
          </p>

          There are 2 main fault tolerance mechanisms in TensorFlow:
          <ol class="personal-page-list">
          <li>
            <span>1.</span>
            <p>
            As is the case with MapReduce, TF may choose restart the execution of a graph.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>2.</span>
            <p>
             The checkpoint feature is also available. Each variable will store its data
             incrementally on a save node. The system can be restarted from the previously
             checkpointed state. This is akin to the checkpointing API in Apache Spark.
            </p>
          </li>
          </ol>
        <h4 class="subtitle" id="subsection14">Implementation</h4>
        <p>
        By making use of distributed learning for a deep learning algorithm, we should be
        able to train the same model faster. Distribution can be achieved by leveraging devices
        on the same machine or on a cluster, which may be accessed through a cloud platform
        (i.e. <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google's Cloud Platform</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
        Below I have extended the MNIST ML example. Much of the code is the same as the
        previous version, but minor changes have been made to make the code distributed.

          code over their Cloud Platform. Said to perform at 45 TFLOPS with increased
          bandwidth to 600GB/s. Google claims these chips were used to run TensorFlow with
          MapReduce in the AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol match.
